# RUL
In the following barplot, There are multiple models acrossdifferent noise levels incorporated in the testing data for measuring for the model robustness. This test resulted in the catboost model performing the best in terms of learn the lrger extent of target distribuion where even with noise injection to the test data, the model was able to provide relaible extimation which can also be confirm use the mean absolute error scores of these models.
